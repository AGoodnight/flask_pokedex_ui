# Pokedex Python UI with PySide2 and QT

### Getting Started
First create a virtual environment and install PySide2: https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/

### Compilation Dependencies
You will need to install clang to compile c++
You can download that from here: http://download.qt.io/development_releases/prebuilt/libclang/

Then unpack clang and make sure to point to it.

<code>
7z x .../libclang-release_60-windows-vs2015_64-clazy.7z
SET LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=%CD%\libclang
</code>
